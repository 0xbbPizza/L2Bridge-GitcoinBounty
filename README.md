# L2Bridge-GitcoinBounty
This is a bounty to implement @vbuterin's idea of a decentralized cross-layer-2 bridge.  Idea described in more detail here: https://notes.ethereum.org/@vbuterin/cross_layer_2_bridges  The prize for this bounty is one winner who gets 10 ETH and an introduction to the EF Grants Team. At our discretion, we may reward secondary prizes if (and only if) there are multiple high quality submissions.  How it works:      read the spec     create a cross layer 2 bridge prototype (ui, smart contract).     submit work on Gitcoin by 3/1/2022 (march 1 2022).
